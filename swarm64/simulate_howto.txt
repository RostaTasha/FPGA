Note:

If you add or re-name any files, you'll have to update the Makefile accordingly

If you are having problems, contact us as soon as possible! We don't want you to spend time
on technical problems instead of working on the excercise :-)

If you're on a 32-bit system (e.g. a virtual machine), you will have to re-build verilator:
cd verilator*
./configure
make
cd ..
