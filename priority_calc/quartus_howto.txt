To check the timing of your design, find:
Tasks (window on the left of the screen) -> TimeQuest Timing Analysis -> View Report

Double click "View Report", and wait until finished.

Check:
Slow 1100mV 85C Model -> Fmax Summary -> Fmax
Slow 1100mV 0C Model -> Fmax Summary -> Fmax

These report your achieved frequency at two different temperatures. 
Both should be above your target frequency. 
They will be shown in red if target frequency is not met.
